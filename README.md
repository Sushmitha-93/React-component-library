# A Reusable React Component Library

Deployed: [https://sushmitaportfolio.com/React-component-library/](https://sushmitaportfolio.com/React-component-library/)

This project leverages several key concepts to ensure the components are reusable and maintainable:

1. **Reusable React Patterns**: Implementation of reusable patterns to enhance flexibility and reusability:

   - **Component Composition**: Components are designed to be composed together, allowing for flexible and modular UI development.
   - **Higher-Order Components (HOCs)**: Reuse component logic by wrapping components.
   - **Render Props**: Share code between React components using a prop whose value is a function.
   - **Compound Components**: Allow components to work together in a coordinated way.

2. **Props and State Management**: Effective use of props and state to manage data flow and component behavior.
3. **Hooks**: Utilization of React hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, and custom hooks to encapsulate logic and side effects.
4. **Styling**: Most styling is written manually, with external libraries used for the documentation page.
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation and examples for each component to facilitate ease of use and integration.

These concepts collectively contribute to the creation of a robust and reusable component library that can be easily integrated into various projects.
